## Error Notifications

To turn off error notifications, go to your [Forcefield preferences](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyuR18yqYaULKcSN8dV0D77OLW24KzHBjZIqENeSMjb-PAGmYE/exec) and click "Advanced Settings" at the bottom.

Find "Error Notifications" and turn it off. Then click "Save Preferences" at the bottom of the page.

You may still occasionally get error notifications from Google directly, due to temporary issues connecting to Google services. (Unfortunately, these notifications cannot be disabled.) This is okay if it happens infrequently, since the script will just run again in a minute. If it happens often, please post on [our message board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/forcefield-apps-script) and tell us about the issue you're having.
