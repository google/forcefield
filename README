Forcefield is a script for Google Apps Script that helps you manage your email
so that it doesn't show up in your inbox outside of working hours. If you've
ever felt pressured to read and respond to work email when you should be
unwinding, this was designed for you.

This script works together with a filter in Gmail. The filter moves all of your
email to a folder within Gmail, and marks it read, so that it doesn't show up
in your inbox or cause notifications on your phone or other devices.

Forcefield then checks every minute, and if during normal working hours, it
moves your email back to your inbox and marks it unread again. During off-work
hours, mail will stay in your Forcefield folder until work hours start again,
and then move all of the built-up mail back to your inbox.

To set up Forcefield, go to https://google.github.io/forcefield/ and follow the
instructions there, or go to https://google.github.io/forcefield/own-copy/ to
create your own copy of Forcefield.
