## Uninstalling

We're sorry that Forcefield isn't for you; here's how to uninstall it.

First, you'll need to remove the filter from Gmail:

1. In Gmail, go to Settings -> Filters.
1. Look for the filter that says 'Do this: Skip Inbox, Mark as read, Apply label "Forcefield"'.
1. Click "delete" to the right of that filter, and click "OK" to confirm.

Then, uninstall the Forcefield script:

1. Go to [the uninstall page](https://script.google.com/macros/d/M9uDjMc__xkURvdbWYY_OZLDFnk49QqJF/manage/uninstall)
2. Click "Uninstall."

You're done! If you feel like leaving some feedback, feel free to visit [our forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/forcefield-apps-script) and explain what you would like Forcefield to do better.
