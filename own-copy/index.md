## Setting up your own copy of the Forcefield script

1. Go to [the current version of Forcefield](https://script.google.com/d/1QGyB6Q-JXhgWGdxJaEMPvavtj7y0DvDPemi_xyT1dSt_50nHLUu5Z66s/edit?usp=sharing) in the Apps Script editor.
1. To get your own copy, go to the File menu (in Apps Script, not your browser), and choose "Make a copy." This will save a copy to your Google Drive.
1. From within [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), open your copy. (You will be prompted to install a Drive application in order to enable opening Apps Script projects from Drive.)
1. In the Apps Script editor, with your copy of Forcefield open, go to the Resources menu and choose "Advanced Google services."
1. In the menu that pops up, click on "Google Developers Console."
1. Find the option that says "Gmail API" and toggle it to "on".
1. Go back to the Apps Script editor and click the Publish menu and choose "Deploy as web app."
1. Under "Execute the app as," choose "User accessing the web app."
1. Click "Update."
1. You will see a box saying your web app is now deployed, along with a URL. Copy the URL underneath the text that says "Current web app URL," and paste it into a new browser tab.
1. This will take you to the preferences page for Forcefield. Choose the hours you want to receive mail, and click "Save Preferences" at the bottom.
